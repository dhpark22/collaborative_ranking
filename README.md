Preference Completion: Large-scale Collaborative Ranking from Pairwise Comparison

This repo contains the implementation of the following algorithms:
- Alternating SVM (AltSVM)
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Global Ranking from All-aggregated pairwise comparisons 

Basically, the executable takes pairwise comparisons, but will be updated so that it can take ratings.
